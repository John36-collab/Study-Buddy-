AI Study Buddy - Flashcard Generator

Project Overview

AI Study Buddy is a web application that transforms study notes into interactive flashcards using AI-powered question generation. The application leverages modern web technologies and machine learning to create an effective study tool.

Architecture Overview

The application follows a client-server architecture with clear separation between frontend presentation, backend processing, and AI integration components.

Frontend Structure

· HTML5 Components: Semantic markup for accessibility and structure
· CSS Animations: Transform-based flip effects and transition animations
· JavaScript Modules:
  · User interface management
  · API communication handlers
  · Flashcard interaction logic
  · Dynamic content rendering

Backend Structure

· Flask Application: RESTful API endpoints for processing requests
· Route Handlers: Dedicated endpoints for text processing and card management
· Database Integration: MySQL connector with connection pooling
· API Gateway: Middleware for Hugging Face API communication

Database Schema

· Flashcards Table: Stores generated questions and answers
· User Sessions Table: Tracks user interactions and preferences
· Content Metadata: Stores information about generated content

Workflow Explanation

1. Input Processing Phase

· User submits study notes through a web form interface
· Frontend validates and sanitizes input content
· Data is packaged into JSON format for API transmission
· HTTP POST request sent to Flask backend endpoint

2. AI Processing Phase

· Flask receives and parses the study notes content
· Backend constructs appropriate prompt for question generation
· Request is authenticated and sent to Hugging Face API
· AI model processes text and generates quiz questions
· Response is parsed and formatted into structured data

3. Card Generation Phase

· Structured question-answer pairs are returned to frontend
· JavaScript processes response and creates DOM elements
· CSS animations are applied to create flip-card effect
· Interactive event handlers are attached to each card
· Generated content is simultaneously stored in database

4. Data Persistence

· MySQL database connection established through connection pool
· Prepared statements used for secure data insertion
· Flashcard content stored with timestamp and metadata
· Retrieval mechanisms implemented for saved content access

Component Interactions

Frontend-Backend Communication

· RESTful API design with JSON data exchange
· HTTP status code handling for error management
· Asynchronous request processing with error fallbacks
· Loading states and user feedback mechanisms

Backend-AI Integration

· Secure API token management through environment variables
· Request timeout and retry mechanisms
· Response validation and error handling
· Batch processing capabilities for large text inputs

Database Operations

· Connection pooling for efficient resource management
· Transaction handling for data integrity
· Query optimization for performance
· Backup and recovery procedures

Security Considerations

· API token protection through environment variables
· Input sanitization against injection attacks
· CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
· Database credential encryption
· HTTPS enforcement for production deployment

Performance Features

· Client-side caching of generated flashcards
· Database indexing for quick retrieval
· Async/Await patterns for non-blocking operations
· Memory management for large text processing
· Responsive design for cross-device compatibility

Extension Capabilities

· Modular design allowing additional AI model integration
· Scalable database structure for user management features
· Plugin architecture for additional study tools
· Export functionality for external use
· Multi-language support infrastructure

This architecture provides a robust foundation for the AI Study Buddy application, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and a smooth user experience throughout the flashcard generation and study process.
